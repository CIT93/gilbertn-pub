For my Dev_1 project I will be using the same topic I used for my Dev_0 project. My topic is iPhone screen time tracker. I will create an input for the user to type their name and a dropdown menu that has two options. One that has the lowest ranked category, and a second option with the highest ranked category. If the user selects the option with the lowest ranked category, it will the read the lowest ranked category with the screen time and it will also show the least used app. However, if the user selects the option with the highest ranked category it will read the highest ranked category with the screen time and it will also show the most used app. Once the input has been created and read by the user, they will have the chance to delete and edit their decision. If the user decides to edit their decision, they can do so by choosing whether the screen time is average or above average.
